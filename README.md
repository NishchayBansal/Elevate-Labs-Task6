**5. Identify best practices for creating strong passwords.**
**6. Write down tips learned from the evaluation.**

1. Use a password that is at least 12 characters long.
2.	Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
3.	Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.
4.	Avoid using personal information like your name, birthday, or phone number.
5.	Avoid using common words, phrases, or easily guessable patterns.
6.	Consider using memorable phrase/ phrase that has some meaning to you. 
7.	 Consider using a password generator tool to create random, complex, and unique passwords. 

**7. Research common password attacks (brute force, dictionary).**

üîê Brute Force Attack
This attack tries all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found.
It is time-consuming and computationally intensive but guarantees success eventually.
Brute force tools can automate the process and target weak passwords easily.
Using complex passwords and account lockout mechanisms helps prevent it.

üìñ Dictionary Attack
It uses a predefined list of likely passwords (dictionary) to guess the correct one.
The attack relies on users choosing common or simple passwords found in the list.
It is faster than brute force but limited to the words in the dictionary.
To defend against it, users should avoid predictable or common passwords.

**8. Summarized how password complexity affects security.**

Password complexity, which refers to the difficulty in guessing or cracking a password, directly impacts security. More complex passwords, characterized by length, variety of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and unpredictability, are significantly harder to crack using brute force or dictionary attacks. This increased difficulty translates to better security, making it more challenging for unauthorized individuals to access accounts and data.
